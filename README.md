# TRAVELAGO-MERN
Project on a vacation home renting site 
TRAVELAGO
Travelago is the name of my full stack web development that I’ve created, which is a vacation home renting website having a plethora of functionalities. It’s basically a site where people willing to rent their villas and farmhouses can easily post about the various amenities about their house and the vicinity it possess. It also aids them to make it possible for people searching to spend their holidays lavishly with their families without much issues. It enables them to have an access to the location where the house is situated. It’s an initiative took to have a source of income for those people as well. It serves as an efficient medium between the buyers and renters. It encompasses numerous components ranging from a user-friendly homepage to display of pictures of the vacation home. It allows users from any corner of the world to check if they have any vacation home available in their surroundings. It’s prototype which does have a future scope of improvement to implement the feature of payment via back account and also the tracking of location where the user is. Its database can also be made more vast so as to have an immense amount of entries so as to have maximum number of options. Thus, due to an exponential increase in the demand of masses to spend their vacation in a homely environment and to have a warm hospitality with reasonable prices per night, as well are aware of the fact that resorts charge an exorbitantly high amount just to spend an entire week there and the hospitality isn’t upto the mark as well. Therefore, in order to allow people to help people the tale of this website began.  
 
Technologies Used

FRONTEND: For the frontend,I used the React+Vite,as it helps in building a robust frontend and a client side application.

For styling and formatting components around, I incorporated Tailwind CSS, as it’s wuite handy and can be used in b/w react jsx components with ease and saves a lot of memory and time.
                                   

DATABASE: In order to store and have a grip over entries for login, register  and placing a payment, the database was of pristine importance,thus to take care of the data, I used MongoDB application(online mode) as it follows a non-SQL schema enabling us to add data in any format unlike SQL where a particular tuple required to be of uniform format, here non-relational database can also be formed providing a flexibility to users to store their details along with images with their password being hashed and encrypted safely. 



BACKEND: For any website,the most integral part is it has a backend being configured perfectly, otherwise data can be lost thus, data integrity is the need of the hour at the same time, forbidding users to see what’s happening behind the scenes of the website is also required as users can unknowingly tamper with the frontend but backend being latent can’t be mishandled. So keeping all these things in mind, I’ve used NODE.js as the perfect combination of node with react helps in building a determined framework and interface, as both being javascript frameworks. Along with NODE, I’ve used many packages like EXPRESS,MULTER,DATE-FNS,IMAGE-UPLOADER which comes handy with node. 


EXPRESS being the template through which complements the NODE and also helps in establishing a server to handle the backend effectively.




NETWORK AND REQUEST HANDLING: In order to control a myriad of requests be it GET,POST or PUT request we required an application layer protocol which can handle any sort of request,thus HTTPS was incorporated using AXIOS which serves as an effective medium to cater requests of all kinds. To procure a robust network, CORS was also used so as to connect ports of different origins together and build a medium to amalgamate the frontend and backend. Moreover, it’s functionality being connecting the different origins possessing webpages.
